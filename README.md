AlertMarker-ios
===============

This is a simple iOS version of [Matthew Browne's AlertMarker Android sample app][alertmarker].  It was shown as part of a talk given by [Michael Wybrow][michael] at a three day Android App Programming workshop run in July 2012 by the Clayton School of Information Technology at Monash University.

This sample mirrors the functionality of the Android version at the end of day 2 of the workshop.

The project should be opened with Xcode 4.4 or newer.  Note, the project doesn't contain a nice MVC separation for things like the persistent storage for user-created location pins, which was ommitted to make the demonstration and creation of the code faster during the talk.  This cleanup, and the location alerts are left as an exercise for the reader.

This code is released into the public dominan.  You can copy, modify, and distribute this work, all without asking permission.
